# TripM
TripM is a cab agency management system designed to help cab agencies efficiently manage their workload. The system provides features for both the admin and driver sides
of the cab agency.

On the admin side, TripM allows admins to manage agents, drivers, and vehicles. This includes adding records, as well as generating reports 
and analytics to help the agency make informed business decisions. Admins can also manage bookings, assign trips to drivers, and monitor driver performance.

On the driver side, TripM allows drivers to manage their trips, expenses, and payments. Drivers can view their assigned trips, update trip status, 
and submit expenses for reimbursement.
